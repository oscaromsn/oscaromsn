AI Engineer / Lawyer (PUC/SP). Former criminal law practitioner at top Brazilian firms, co-founder of [Pindograma](https://pindograma.com.br) (data journalism — built Brazil's largest electoral poll aggregator).

Currently focused on modeling the legal domain with emphasis on **steerability** and **explainability**.

I believe good legal AI requires hybrid architectures: deterministic workflows for predictable, auditable paths + unconstrained loops for better "exploration/exploitation" during long-running tasks.

## Current work

- 🔬 Innovation Resident @ **InovaUSP** — Building and validating GenAI products for legal practice using design thinking
- ⚖️ Integrating Brazilian court APIs (Datajud / BNP / MNI) into AI agents
- 🔓 Reverse engineering undocumented court systems via HTTP traffic analysis when official APIs don't exist
- 🔗 Designing multi-step tool-use patterns for nuanced legal reasoning during exploratory tasks
- 🧠 Working on neuro-symbolic approaches for high-stakes decisions (LLMs/SLMs for structured extraction + deterministic reasoning engine based on decision trees)

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**whatsapp-evidence**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/whatsapp-evidence) | CLI tool to convert WhatsApp audio and screenshots into structured markdown for legal proceedings in Brazil. BAML vision extraction + ElevenLabs transcription. |
| [**research-squad**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/research-squad) | Multi-agent research system built with Effect + BAML. Hierarchical orchestration, structured concurrency, contract-driven TDD. Inspired by "How we built our multi-agent research system" by Anthropic. |
| [**TalentScore**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/TalentScore) | Resume Scoring System built with Effect, BAML, and React. Demonstrates structured LLM extraction for deterministic, explainable document assessment and scoring. |
| [**harvest-mcp**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/harvest-mcp) | MCP server that reverse engineers APIs from HAR files and generates TypeScript wrappers. LLM-powered dependency graph analysis. |
| [**inpi-agent**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/inpi-agent) | Minimal BAML agent with calculator + INPI database access. Reference implementation in Portuguese for the Brazilian dev community. |
