Lawyer (PUC/SP) focused on modeling the legal domain with emphasis on **steerability** and **explainability**.

I believe good legal AI requires hybrid architectures: deterministic workflows for predictable, auditable paths + unconstrained loops for nuanced reasoning. This mirrors how lawyers actually work — structured procedure with judgment at decision points.

## Current work

- 🔬 Innovation Resident @ **InovaUSP** — R&D on GenAI for legal tech
- ⚖️ Integrating Brazilian court APIs (Datajud / BNP / MNI) into AI agents
- 🔓 Reverse engineering undocumented court systems via HTTP traffic analysis when official APIs don't exist
- 🔗 Designing multi-step tool-use patterns for nuanced legal reasoning
- 🧠 Exploring neuro-symbolic approaches for high-stakes decisions (LLM for parsing structured outputs + deterministic reasoning engine according to decision trees)

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**research-squad**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/research-squad) | Multi-agent research system built with Effect + BAML. Hierarchical orchestration, structured concurrency, contract-driven TDD. |
| [**harvest-mcp**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/harvest-mcp) | MCP server that reverse engineers APIs from HAR files and generates TypeScript wrappers. LLM-powered dependency graph analysis. |
| [**inpi-agent**](https://github.com/oscaromsn/inpi-agent) | Simple BAML agent with calculator + INPI database access. Reference implementation in Portuguese for the Brazilian dev community. |

**Interests:** effect systems, event-driven architecture, declarative DSLs, workflow vs. actor-based modeling for legal processes.
